- Review: This course will give you a good understanding of Multivariable Calculus, which is used in numerouse fields in Engineering, Physics etc... The content of the course isn't a hardcore calculus course and rather a practical version suitable for Engineers. But you will get everything you need to understand other applications. I used the official website to watch the course and then did my book according to the course. The correct part of the book following the book will be in the readings section of the official website. The difficulty of the questions in the book is good so I recommend this way of self studying. Notes and exams provided in the website is also excelent if you want to go further. Overall this is a very good course if you want to dig in a bit more into multivariable calculus.
