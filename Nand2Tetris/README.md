- Prerequisites: any programming language of choice

- Rating: **5/5**

- Review: This course provides a comprehensive introduction to how computers work, covering everything from low-level concepts like logic gates to high-level topics such as compilers and operating systems.

-The course is divided into two parts:

-The first part focuses on hardware and low-level systems. You will gradually build a complete computer, starting from Boolean logic and logic gates, then moving on to designing a CPU and RAM. The course provides an official web IDE, making it easy to complete all the projects directly on your computer. Going through these projects is highly satisfying, and by the end, you will have a strong understanding of how low-level computer hardware works.

-The second part is significantly more challenging, requiring about three times more effort than the first. It shifts towards computer science concepts, requiring you to code and build things. While the official course does not assume any prerequisites, having a solid grasp of a programming language is essentialâ€”especially for the second part. In this section, you will work on compiling high-level programs to machine code, essentially building a compiler. The course introduces its own specific language, making the compiler project more manageable than building one for a conventional language. However, it still provides an excellent introduction to compilers and a deep understanding of how code translates into machine instructions.

- If you ever need help, the official forum and GitHub repositories (including mine) offer useful resources.

- I highly recommend this course to anyone curious about how computers work or those looking for a solid introduction to computer systems.
