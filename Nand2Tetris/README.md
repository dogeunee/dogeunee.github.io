- Review: This course will help you get a good grasp of how computers work. It covers from very low level things such as logic gates to high level things like compilers and operating systems. Consisting in two parts, the first part you will learn how low level hardware is built. You will build a full computer by learning boolean logic and logic gates to making a CPU and RAM. It supplies an official web ide so you can do all the projects easily using ur computer. It is very satisfying to go through all the projects and will give you a general idea of how low level computer works. The second part takes about three times more effort as it is more like a CS course that wants you to code and build things. Even though the official course doesn't expect any prerequisites, to go through all the projects especailly in the second part of the course you must have a decent enought profficiency in a programming language of your choice. The projects that have to do with this part are for compiling high level programs to machine level code. Basicaly you will be writing a compiler. It has a course specific language so it will be easy than making a full compiler for conventional languages and it will give you a good grasp of compilers and how your code actually works behind. You can find good sources that will help you in the official forum and sources in github like mine. I recommend this course for anyone who wants to get an idea of how computer works or people who wants to get an introductional course for computer systems.
