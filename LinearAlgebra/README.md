- Review:
 this is a great course for a Linear algebra introductory course. The lectures are very insightful and very clear with each course less than an hour (usually around 50 min). The book explains the topic in more detail than the book. The questions aren’t too hard rather I’d say easy to medium. I didn’t solve the quizzes provided in the website I instead solved ones in the book. If they are too easy and repetitive I solved half of them and I solved all of the questions from chapters that I’m unfamiliar. Exams we’re not that hard as well.

The main characteristic of the course is that it is based on intuition compared to rather proof-based algebra books. It won’t be very strict about proofs so if you prefer proof based explanations and understanding things very firmly step-by-step, this is not the course for you. But you will get a very good intuition about matrices and deeper understanding about using them. To add more, other Linear Algebra courses start from transformations and then move on to matrices. But this course approaches the subject by concentrating more on the matrices and using them instead. So I suggest taking another proof based course. My recommendations are ‘Linear Algebra done right’ or ‘Linea Algebra by Friedberg’.
