- Review: This is a great introductory course for Linear Algebra. The lectures are insightful and clearly explained, with each session lasting less than an hour (typically around 50 minutes). The textbook provides more in-depth explanations than the lectures.

The exercises are not too difficult, ranging from easy to medium. Instead of solving the quizzes provided on the course website, I worked through the exercises in the textbook. If the problems felt too easy or repetitive, I solved only about half of them. However, for chapters I was unfamiliar with, I made sure to solve all the problems. The exams were also not particularly difficult.

One of the key characteristics of this course is that it focuses on intuition rather than a proof-based approach. Unlike traditional algebra textbooks that emphasize formal proofs, this course is less rigorous in that aspect. If you prefer proof-based explanations and a step-by-step, rigorous understanding, this course might not be the best fit for you.

That said, this course provides strong intuition about matrices and a deep understanding of how to use them. Additionally, many Linear Algebra courses start with transformations before introducing matrices, but this course takes a matrix-first approach, focusing on their application from the start.

If you want a more proof-heavy course, I recommend supplementing this course with:
