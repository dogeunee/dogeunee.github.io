# Self Study Soldier

Hi! This is Dogeun.

I live in South Korea and am currently serving in the ROK Air Force for my mandatory military service. I started my service in May 2025, and throughout my 21 months, I wanted to explore the fields of Computer Science (CS) and Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE) to deepen my knowledge.

I will regularly share what I have been studying on this blog, and I hope it helps others on their self-study journey.

**Reviews(finished date):**

[Missimg Semester](./MissingCS) (Oct 2024)

[Nand2Tetris](./Nand2Tetris) (Oct 2024)

[MultivariableCalculus](./MultiCal) (Dec 2024)

[CSAPP](./CSAPP) (Feb 2025)

[MachineLearning](./ML) (March 2025)

[Probability](./Prob) (May 2025)

[Mathematical Foundations of Deep Neural Networks](./MFDNN) (June 2025)

These are the reasons why I am starting this blog.

**1. motivation for myself**

Self-studying is quite challenging. I believe the best way to stay consistent is to enjoy the process. The ideal scenario is to genuinely enjoy the subjects I study, but excitement can fade when studying for extended periods.

By maintaining this blog and writing reviews about the content I study, I hope to stay motivated. Looking back at completed courses will give me a sense of accomplishment and push me to keep going.

**2. Sharing**

Everything I am learning comes from free online resources—whether university courses, blog posts, or open-source materials. I want to give back by sharing my experiences and reviews.

I’m not sure how many people will read my blog, but I hope it helps someone

Here are some excellent resources that will guide your self-study journey:

[1.teachyourselfcs](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)
The best CS self-study guide, in my opinion.

[2.OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)
A famous open-source CS curriculum. It includes more tideous courses compared to Teach Yourself CS, but it's worth checking out.

[3.Peking](https://csdiy.wiki/en/)

Written by a CS student, this guideline is very in depth and has a lot of good quality courses. 

[4.MIT challange](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/)
Great source to check for MIT courses in ECE&CS.

How I study and My plan

I usually stick to a course that has video lectures. First I start watching the video lecture. Second, I read the corresponding part from the main text book and solve the examples and questions. I don't rush and watch multiple video lectures in advance before going thru the text book as every lecture assumes thorough understanding of the previous contents. Third I do all the quizzes and exams in the course website.  I picked the courses mostly from MIT because their OCW content matches my style of studying and has no downgrades from an actual university course.
