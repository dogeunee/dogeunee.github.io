# Self Study Soldier

 Hi! this is Dogeun.

 I live in South Korea and I am currently working in the ROK Airforce for my mandatory military service. I started my service at May 2025 and through out my 21 months I wanted to explore the field of CS and ECE to improve my knowleadge. I will regularly share what I have been studying in this blog and I hope it helps out people on their Self Studying Journey.

**Reviews(finished date):**

[Linear Algebra](./LinearAlgebra) (Sep 2024)

[Missimg Semester](./MissingCS) (Oct 2024)

[Nand2Tetris](./Nand2Tetris) (Oct 2024)

[MultivariableCalculus](./MultiCal) (Dec 2024)

These are the reasons why I am starting this blog.

**1. motivation for myself**

 Self studying is quite hard. I believe the best way to keep on doing something is to enjoy the process. The best is to enjoy the subjects that I am studying, however its hard to keep the excitement when you are studying in an extensive period of time. So I thought by maintaining a blog and writing a review of the content of what I am studying will keep me satisfied every time I finish a course and look forward to completing a course. 

**2. Sharing**

 All the content I will be learning is from the internet made by a bunch of people including the course from universities to blog posts. I just want to return the help I got from participating and writing a review on the internet. I'm not sure how many people will be reading my blog but I hope it helps somebody.



These are some amazing websites that will guide ur self studying journey

[1.teachyourselfcs](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)

best studying guidline for CS in my opinion.

[2.OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)

Famous online guidline for CS. l feel like it has more surplus courses compared to teach your self cs. But its worth to check it out.

[3.Peking](https://csdiy.wiki/en/)

Written by a CS student, this guideline is very in depth and has a lot of good quality courses. 

[4.MIT challange](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/)
Great source to check for MIT courses in ECE&CS.

How I study and My plan

I usually stick to a course that has video lectures. First I start watching the video lecture. Second, I read the corresponding part from the main text book and solve the examples and questions. I don't rush and watch multiple video lectures in advance before going thru the text book as every lecture assumes thorough understanding of the previous contents. Third I do all the quizzes and exams in the course website.  I picked the courses mostly from MIT because their OCW content matches my style of studying and has no downgrades from an actual university course.
