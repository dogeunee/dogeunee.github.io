- Review: This is a great course if you want to brush up on your undergraduate probability. It rigorously teaches all the tools you need to solve probability problems. I studied the lectures, then read the book and solved the problems and exams while following the pace of the lectures.

- The lecture + book combo is good enough in my opinion, but if you want more practice problems, you can also use the recitations, tutorials, and assignments available on the course website.

- This course is perfect for engineering students. However, if youâ€™re looking to study more in-depth probability theory, you might consider taking probability courses offered by the math department.

- Overall, I am very happy that I took this class and I reccomend anybody who wants to have a deeper understanding of probiblity.
