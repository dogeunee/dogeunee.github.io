- Prerequisites: Experience with C

- Rating: **5/5**

- Review:This is an outstanding course that provides a deep understanding of computer systems while serving as an excellent stepping stone for more advanced topics such as operating systems, computer architecture, and networking. It offers both breadth and depth, requiring significant time and effort. The course is centered around the famous Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective (CSAPP) textbook, which spans over 1,000 pages, along with intensive labs that will have you coding extensively.

- Fortunately, all course materials, including lecture videos and labs, are available online. Completing this course will significantly enhance your ability to grasp higher-level topics by giving you a solid understanding of how computers work at a fundamental level. Since the course is based on C, I highly recommend learning C beforehand to make the experience smoother.
